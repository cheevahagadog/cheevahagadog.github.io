      <description>Almost completed with a machine learning project, I was asked by the client if I could include what the reasons where for each prediction. I had done feature importances before, but never was I asked to (or thought of) listing out what the reasons where behind each prediction made by my model.
Here, I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain how I approached that problem and what worked, and what I had to do.</description>
