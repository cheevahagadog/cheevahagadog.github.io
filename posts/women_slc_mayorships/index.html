<!-- ## Step 1. Background
 -->

<p>This recent election in Utah has brought about some big shifts. After twenty four years and 6 terms, Tom Dolan was succeeded by Kurt Bradburn as mayor of Sandy. Jim Curtis’ victory in the 3rd Congressional District created an opening for the Provo Mayorship. Breaking from a long line of white male mayors <a href="http://www.provolibrary.com/historical-mayors-provo">stretching back to 1851</a>, Michelle Kaufusi and Hall Everett secured the first and second place positions in the <a href="http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/central/provo/provo-guaranteed-its-first-female-mayor-come-jan/article_63b7a6be-b644-5fd7-b485-36cd9767baff.html">primaries</a>, guaranteeing Provo its first female mayor. When Michelle Kaufusi won on November 8, her mayorship was automatically historic.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely, women are entering into local mayorship leadership in the Salt Lake valley as well. Right now, almost 25 percent of mayorships in the valley are being lead by women. That’s the most we’ve ever seen- over the last ten years women have only lead between 15 to 22 percent of total mayorships in the Salt Lake.</p>

<p><img src="/img/timeline.png" alt="timeline" /></p>

<p>Female candidates have run and won recently in Midvale, Salt Lake and South Salt Lake. In the latter, <a href="http://www.southsaltlakecity.com/city-government/mayor">Cherie Wood</a> made history in 2010 when she became the first female mayor of South Salt Lake with 61.9 percent of the vote. Since then she has maintained consistent victories with a close 50.9 percent in 2013 and another slim margin at 51.9 percent this year.</p>

<p><img src="/img/updated_sm.png" alt="updated_sm" /></p>

<p>In 2015 Jackie Biskupski became the <a href="http://www.southsaltlakecity.com/city-government/mayor">second female mayor of Salt Lake</a>, winning by a slim lead at 51.5 percent.</p>

<p>Female candidates are also starting to enter for the mayorships of Herriman, Draper, West Valley and Taylorsville. In the past two mayoral elections in West Valley, Karen Lang ran twice against Ron Bigelow. She didn’t win, but her voter share has gone up from 38% to 45%, nearly a 8 percent gain. If that pattern holds then she will definitely win next time.</p>

<p>Yet, the mayor office is still male dominated. At each mayoral election over the past ten years, there are mayorships where no women have entered the race, such as Cottonwood Heights, Riverton, Holladay, and Sandy.</p>

<p><img src="/img/turnout.png" alt="turnout" /></p>

<p>Male candidates have outnumbered the female candidates for years and by a large margin. Interestingly, male and female candidates have had nearly the same ratio of newcomers (total unique candidates divided by total candidates for that gender); male candidates have a 78 percent newcomer rate and female candidates have a 79 percent newcomer rate. Salt Lake can count on new candidates trying their luck each election, creating opportunities to further balance out female representation at the mayoral level.</p>

<p>2017 seems to have set the stage for future changes in the statistics of women in local government. Charlotte North Carolina elected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi_Lyles">Vi Lyles</a> - their first black female mayor. <a href="http://nhpr.org/post/joyce-craig-becomes-manchesters-first-elected-female-mayor#stream/0">Joyce Craig</a> became the first female mayor of Manchester New Hampshire, and that is just a sample of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/8/16622884/women-minorities-lgbtq-candidates-made-history">historic firsts</a> accomplished this year.</p>

<p>Utah is no exception to this trend and as more women continue to run for and enter office a more balanced dialogue will begin to shape our communities.</p>
